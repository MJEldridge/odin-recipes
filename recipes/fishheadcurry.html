        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Firstly, rinse the fish head throughly.</li>
            <li>Using a mortar and pestle, crush the ginger well.</li>
            <li>Rub thr fish thoroughly with the crushed ginger, and a good sprinkling of salt.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle coriander leaves over the fish.</li>
            <li>Place a steamer rack(above boiling water) and steam covered for 15 minutes. Then set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a wide carbon steel wok OR an earthen pot.</li>
            <li>Add the fenugreek seeds and curry leaves. Allow to crackle.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped garlic and as soon as it's soft, add the chopped onion.</li>
            <li>Stir, and cook till the onions are soft and lightly golden - do not allow them to go brown.</li>
            <li>Now add all the spice powders.</li>
            <li>Stir and cook, adding a sprinkling of water so that the spices do not burn.</li>
            <li>Cook till the raw smell of the spices is gone.</li>
            <li>Add 2 1/2 cups of water.</li>
            <li>Bring to the boil.</li>
            <li>Add salt, tamarind solution, chopped tomato, lemongrass, and sliced ginger.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped okra to a hot pan with some oil and toss very briefly, just till they have turned bright green in color.</li>
            <li>When the curry has simmered briefly, add the chopped vegetables. Also, add the red chilli.</li>
            <li>Add the coconut cream and cook on low till simmered.</li>
            <li>Now gently add the steamed fish head. Coat the fish head well in the curry.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook on low heat for <strong>5 - 8 minutes.</strong> Do not stir the curry or the fish head might come apart, instead swirl the pot when needed.</li>
            <li>After the curry as rested a while, you may choose to remove the bruised lemongrass - so that the aroma does not become to strong.</li>
            <li>When it's time to serve, bring to boil again. If using a earthen pot, it will continue to boil. Bring to the serving table while still simmering.</li>
            <li>You can also use a tabletop wax stove to serve the curry simmering.</li> 
            <li>Serve with steamed white rice.</li>
